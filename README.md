# Prop-err

A repo for my GMTK Game Jam 2023 Submission

## What is this game about?

This is a platformer made on the topic ROLES REVERSED for GMTK Game Jam 2023.It has a small twist in its gameplay.

I have implemented rudimentary A.I. Behavior's for both Player and Enemies. 

In this game, you are not given direct control of the player. Instead, you are given control of the objects in the environment. Choose the environmental "PROPS" and position them properly. Hit play and see to it that the player reaches the end door without dying. Some levels have multiple solutions.

Thanks for playing my game. Any feedback and suggestions are most welcome. 

Last but not the least, I want to thank my mentor, bixarrio, for helping me with this project. Without him, I would never have completed this game in time.
